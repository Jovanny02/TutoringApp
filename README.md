# GatorAid - Tutoring Application

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a cross platform tutoring mobile application for University of Florida (UF) students to find and hire other high achieving students as tutors for classes. The motivation behind this was making high quality tutoring more accessible to UF students since currently, it is rather difficult to find help in many classes.
